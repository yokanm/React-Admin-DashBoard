# React Admin Dashboard
A modern and responsive admin dashboard built using React and Material-UI (MUI), designed for visualizing key business metrics, managing transactions, and monitoring data trends. The dashboard is fully customizable, scalable, and features a set of interactive charts, data tables, and statistic cards.

## Features
- Responsive Layout: Seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes with a responsive grid layout.
- Data Visualization: View business insights with LineCharts, BarCharts, and Geographical Maps.
- Key Business Metrics: Displays essential data points such as Emails Sent, Sales Obtained, New Clients, and Website Traffic.
- Recent Transactions: A dynamic list of recent transactions showing details like transaction ID, user, date, and cost.
- Campaign Progress: Visual representation of a campaign’s progress using a circular progress indicator.
- Customizable UI: Easily customizable components for tailoring the dashboard to your needs.
- Interactive Charts: Fully interactive and responsive charts that can be customized with different data sources.
## Technologies Used
- React: JavaScript library for building dynamic UIs.
- Material-UI (MUI): React components for faster and easier web development with Material Design.
- React Hooks: Used to manage state and side-effects in functional components.
- Charting Libraries: Custom chart components (LineChart, BarChart, and GeographyChart) to display metrics in an engaging way.
- React Router: For handling routing and navigation (optional for more complex app structures).
- CSS-in-JS: Styled components to manage custom styles.

# Usage
## Key Features of the Dashboard:
StatBoxes: Displays key statistics such as emails sent, sales obtained, and traffic received in a visually appealing format.
Charts: The dashboard features interactive charts:
LineChart: Displays trends in revenue or other data over time.
BarChart: Shows the quantity of sales or similar metrics.
GeographyChart: Displays geographical data (e.g., traffic by region) in an interactive map.
Recent Transactions: A scrollable list of mock transaction data showing transaction IDs, users, dates, and costs. You can modify this list to display real-time transaction data.
Campaign Progress: A circular progress bar showing the campaign's revenue generation or progress, giving insight into the success of ongoing campaigns.
Download Reports: A button that allows users to download reports (this can be customized to generate actual reports based on your app’s functionality).
Custom Components
StatBox
Purpose: Displays key metrics in a card with a title, subtitle, progress bar, and an icon.
Props:
title: The main value to display.
subtitle: A description of the metric.
progress: Progress represented as a percentage.
increase: A percentage change (e.g., "+21%").
icon: A Material-UI icon that visually represents the metric.
LineChart, BarChart, GeographyChart
Purpose: Display data visually through line, bar, and geographical charts.
Props:
isDashboard: A boolean to adjust the chart for dashboard use (e.g., smaller sizes, tighter layouts).
ProgressCircle
Purpose: A circular progress indicator used to show the completion of a task or progress of a campaign.
Props:
size: The size of the circle (can be customized based on usage).
# Customization
Add New Metrics: To add new stat boxes, simply add another StatBox component and pass it the appropriate props. You can adjust the layout by modifying the gridColumn and gridRow properties.

Modify Chart Data: You can customize the charts by updating the data passed to LineChart, BarChart, and GeographyChart. Just replace the sample data in mockData.js or integrate a real data source like an API.

Styling: Modify the colors, typography, and other UI elements via the theme.js file. The theme configuration uses Material-UI’s theme provider for dynamic styling.
